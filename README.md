# Getting Started with React Data Grid of Syncfusion

The [React Data Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-data-grid?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-data-grid-github-samples) is a feature-rich grid coomponent for displaying data in a tabular format. Its wide range of functionalities includes data binding, editing, Excel-like filtering, custom sorting, aggregating rows, selection, and support for Excel, CSV, and PDF formats.

## Introduction
Learn how easily you can create and configure the React Data Grid from Syncfusion using the "create-react-app" toolchain.
This repository is the exercise files of the below mentioned YouTube video. In this video, I’ll create a new React application using the create-react-app toolchain and then add the React Data Grid by Syncfusion into it using the ej2-react-grids package. Also, I’ll explain the simple customizations that can be done on grid columns, as well as how to enable some important features such as paging, filtering, and grouping.

## Features and Benefits of React Data Grid Component

### High performance
The React DataGrid has optimized design for high-performance. Loads large volumes of data, nearly 1 million+ records, within one second without any performance degradation with the help of row and column virtualization.

### Data binding
Bind data seamlessly with various local and remote data sources such as JSON, OData, WCF, and RESTful web services. The React Data Grid uses the data manager to handle data and supports customizing data requests and processing.

### Paging
Paging is used to view a segment of data from the assigned data source. The React DataGrid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI.

### Sorting
Sort rows either in the ascending or descending order against a column by simply clicking the header. Sort multiple columns’ data by holding Ctrl key + header click. In addition, define your own custom sorting logic based on the application needs.

### Filtering
Filtering helps view particular or related records in the React Data Grid, which meet a given criteria. It supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter.

### Selection
Select rows or cells either by using checkbox or by simply clicking them. Select more than one row or cell by holding Ctrl or Shift or Command, or programmatically.

### Editing
The React DataGrid component supports create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD). In addition to built-in editor components to edit a particular column value, custom editor components can be created according to the application needs using templates.

### Grouping
Group rows to display the data in an organized hierarchical structure either in the ascending or descending order to facilitate easier expansion and collapse of records.

### Keyboard navigation
React Data Grid ensures that every cell is accessible using the keyboard. Major features like sort, select, and edit can be performed using keyboard commands alone; no mouse interaction is required. This helps in creating highly accessible applications using this component.

### Localization
Based on their needs, users can localize all the strings used in the user interface of the React Data Grid component. Uses the localization (l10n) library to localize UI strings.

## Introduction
This is the exercise file of the YouTube video mentioned below. In this video, I created a new React application using the create-react-app toolchain. Included the Essential JS2 React Data Grid into it and enabled the features such as Paging, Filtering, and Grouping. You can also get some overview on how to customize the columns of the React Data Grid.

```
npm install
npm start
```
